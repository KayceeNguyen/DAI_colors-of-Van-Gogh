## Project's Description

    Welcome to Colours of Van Gogh, a website dedicated to exploring the vibrant and expressive world of Vincent Van Gogh's drawings.

    Here, you will find a curated selection of some of Van Gogh's most beloved and iconic drawings, presented alongside important information such as the name of the artwork, the year it was created, and most notably, the unique colour palette that defines each piece.

    Whether you're a seasoned art lover or a curious newcomer to the world of fine art, Colours of Van Gogh is the perfect destination for anyone who appreciates the beauty and complexity of Van Gogh's art.

    By showcasing the colour palettes of each drawing, we hope to provide a deeper understanding of Van Gogh's techniques and creative process, and offer a unique perspective on his work that is both educational and inspiring.

    So come and explore the rich and varied world of Van Gogh's drawings, and discover the many different shades, tones, and hues that make his art so enduringly popular and beloved.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
